# 100-Days-of-LeetCode
This repository documents my 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge, where I consistently solve one or more LeetCode problems each day using C++.
The purpose of this challenge is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and maintain long-term coding discipline.

📌 Objectives

- Develop strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving ability
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and readable code
- Maintain daily consistency through structured problem solving
- Build a well-organized and professional GitHub portfolio

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- Platform: LeetCode
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Editor: Visual Studio Code

📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized on a day-wise basis to clearly reflect daily progress.

Each day’s folder contains:

1) The C++ solution file
2) A README.md explaining:
- Problem intuition
- Approach
- Time and space complexity
