# 🧮 Fibonacci Number – LeetCode 509

<b>Day 3 of 100DaysLeetCode Challenge</b>

This repository contains my solution to LeetCode Problem 509: Fibonacci Number, implemented in C++ using an iterative approach for better performance.

# Problem Description

<b>The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:</b>

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1

<b>Task: </b>

Given an integer n, return the nth Fibonacci number.

# Approach Used

<b>Instead of using recursion (which can be inefficient due to repeated calculations), this solution uses an iterative approach:</b>

- Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers: 0 and 1
- Iteratively calculate the next Fibonacci number up to n
- Store only the last two values to keep space usage minimal

# ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

<b>Time Complexity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O(n)

<b>Space Complexity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O(1)

Efficient and optimized 

# Example: 
<b>Input:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = 6

<b>Output:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8

# Key Takeaways
- Learned how to optimize Fibonacci calculation using iteration
- Avoided recursion to reduce time and space overhead
- Strengthened understanding of loops and variable tracking in C++
