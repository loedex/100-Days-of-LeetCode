Power of Two📌 Problem DescriptionGiven an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.An integer n is a power of two if there exists an integer x such that $n = 2^x$.💡 <b>Intuition</b><i>A power of two is a number that can be divided by 2 repeatedly until it reaches 1.If at any point during the division the number becomes odd (and is not 1), it cannot be a power of two.Numbers less than or equal to 0 are not considered powers of two in this context.</i>🧠 <b>Approach</b>If the number is less than 1, return false immediately.If the number is 1, return true (since $2^0 = 1$).Use a while loop to repeatedly check if the number is divisible by 2.Inside the loop, divide the number by 2 (n = n / 2) as long as the remainder is 0.After the loop finishes, check the final value of the number.If the remaining value is 1, the number is a power of two; otherwise, it is not.⏱️ Complexity Analysis<b>- Time Complexity:</b>$O(\log n)$, because we are dividing the number by 2 in each iteration.<b>- Space Complexity:</b>$O(1)$, since we are only using a single integer variable for calculations.🧪 Example<b>Input:</b>20<b>Output:</b>Number is not Power of Two📝 NotesThis solution follows a straightforward iterative division logic.It handles edge cases like negative numbers and zero by checking if n < 1.The code is written in C++ using a class-based structure for better organization.
